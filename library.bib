abstract = {A concurrent engineering-oriented design database representation model (CE-DDRM) is introduced in this research for supporting various life-cycle aspects in concurrent design. In this model, concepts and behaviors of different design database modeling components, including entities, properties, relationships, tasks, and specifications, are defined at meta-class level. Design database is modeled at two different levels, class level and instance level, representing generic design libraries and special design cases, respectively. A Web-based system architecture is proposed to model distributed design database and allow team-members for different product development life-cycle aspects at different locations to access the design database. This newly introduced approach provides the foundation for developing the next generation CAD systems with concurrent engineering functions. {\textcopyright} 2003 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.},

Based on a literature review, a preliminary metric was developed and used to interview a group of researchers, professors, and managers from the naval industry. Through a qualitative approach, the collected empirical evidence was analyzed and organized in an analytical framework. A pilot test of the metric was then carried out at a shipyard in the city of Rio de Janeiro. The study's results indicate that the metric's application can offer firm managers and government policy-makers relevant information for the design and implementation of business and technological strategies for the supply vessel segment.},

@article{Schøyen2017,
abstract = {Abstract Global marine shipping annually accounts for about one billion tonnes of CO2 equivalent greenhouse gas emissions. Nuclear power propulsion may be an option to de-carbonise some niches of the merchant ocean fleet. This paper considers the three experimental nuclear-powered merchant ships launched and operated in the world so far; the iconic Savannah (USA), Otto Hahn (West Germany) and Mutsu (Japan). They were independently developed and operated in the 1960s and 1970s for technology demonstration and learning. A fourth ship, Sevmorput (Soviet Union/Russia, 1988–to date), is a pioneer in respect of its logistics functions and propulsion system. This paper develops a theoretical framework for the sustainability assessment of nuclear propulsion in ocean merchant shipping and presents a method for exploring nuclear propulsion, relative to flag state, ports, shipping resources and ocean transport services. The experimental ships' transport efficiency is discussed and related to contemporary oil-fired shipping of general cargo, and to recent literature presenting possible future applications of merchant nuclear propulsion in some market niches. Insights provided include: (1) the experiments demonstrate that merchant nuclear propulsion may be technically feasible; (2) port and canal access for merchant nuclear-powered ships may be difficult and restricted; (3) the up-front costs, refuelling and end-of-life decommissioning costs of nuclear-powered ships are vast and uncertain against conventionally-powered ships; (4) because nuclear fuel is comparatively low-cost, the conventional oil-fired ship cost implications of high-speed operations do not apply.},

abstract = {In quite some applications, the linear dynamics of the system under test evolve over time in a smooth nonperiodic manner. The dynamic behavior of such systems is uniquely described by the time-variant frequency response function (TV-FRF). However, since most real-life systems behave nonlinearly to some extent, it is important to detect and quantify the deviation between the ideal linear time-variant (LTV) framework and the true non-LTV dynamics. Therefore, in this paper, a nonparametric estimation procedure is developed for detecting and quantifying the noise level and the level of the nonlinear distortions in TV-FRF measurements using random-phase multisine excitations. As a result, the users can decide whether or not the LTV framework is accurate enough to describe the true dynamics in their particular application. The proposed measurement procedure is illustrated on a time-variant electronic circuit.},

abstract = {In the built environment, a green building rating system provides the project team a framework and a tool to help achieving a better sustainable development. The research presents how Green Building Rating Systems (GBRSs) are environmental-oriented tools and should not be confused with Sustainability Assessment Systems; the latter is defined by the sustainability three pillars; environmental, social and economic. Achieving a green building certification does not necessarily mean that the building succeeded in achieving its environmental targets. The financial-driven and prescriptive implementation of GBRS are reasons behind a masked sustainability outcome. This paper presents an objective analysis between two internationally applied GBRSs; LEED and BREEAM, and two particularly developed for the gulf region; Estidama and GSAS. Those four systems are analyzed with respects to them addressing and prioritizing the sustainability pillars. The study also quantitatively discusses the credit weighting given by these systems, focusing on energy and water criteria. Limitations of GBRSs' application and possible areas of improvement have been highlighted, such as climate change adaptability and the importance of sustainable communities and cities trend. The aim is to help designers and construction stakeholders in defining the development sustainability targets and objectives, without compromising on the local context and regional agenda.},

abstract = {With the evolution observed nowadays in power electronics systems, frequency converters are increasingly used in the grid. However, due to switching techniques employed, the harmonic distortion of the resulting signals became an important parameter to be considered in the design of such converters. For this reason, special attention has been given to the techniques of pulse width modulation (PWM) aimed at reducing the harmonic content. This paper proposes a new methodology for the determination of the PWM pulses, based on the application of nonlinear numerical optimization technique using the Lagrange algorithm for minimizing an objective function. The application of this new technique enables the minimization of the total harmonic distortion (THD) at the same time that restrictions are imposed on the amplitudes of harmonic components of interest. Numerical results demonstrate the potentiality of the proposed methodology. ? 2012 IEEE.},

abstract = {Germany comes in first in a new energy efficiency ranking of the world's major economies, followed by Italy, the European Union as a whole, China, and France, according to the 2014 International Energy Efficiency Scorecard published today by the nonprofit American Council for an Energy-Efficient Economy (ACEEE). New to the rankings this year are four nations: India, Mexico, South Korea, and Spain. Now in its second edition, the ACEEE report (available online at http://aceee.org/portal/national-policy/international-scorecard) finds that, while some countries are still significantly outperforming others, there are substantial opportunities for improved energy efficiency in all economies analysed, including the U.S., which ranked 13th out of 16 nations – behind countries such as China, Canada, and India. The new carbon pollution standards for existing power plants proposed this June by the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) would be a major stride in the direction of greater energy efficiency in the U.S. There are dozens of other international best practices that the U.S. could implement to improve its score.},

Fruto de amplo debate com diversos segmentos da sociedade, os documentos norteiam o planejamento se- torial de alto n{\'{i}}vel. Dentre outros aspectos, estabelecem os objetivos e as diretrizes para o preparo e o emprego das For{\c{c}}as Armadas em sua miss{\~{a}}o de defesa da p{\'{a}}tria e de garantia dos poderes constitucionais. A PND fixa os objetivos da Defesa Nacional e orienta o Estado sobre o que fazer para alcan{\c{c}}{\'{a}}-los. A END, por sua vez, estabelece como fazer o que foi estabelecido pela Pol{\'{i}}tica.

This paper is focused on the potential of Diesel Hybrid power systems to increase fuel efficiency for ocean going slow speed ships. Alternatives in on-board energy generation, management and storage strategies are investigated. The mathematical implementation and simulation of the power train components is demonstrated using a systematic approach. Vessel operational profiles were incorporated to the power train optimisation problem. The optimisation scenarios were run using a modified marine power systems version of the Equivalent Cost Minimisation Strategy. The results indicate fuel savings for auxiliary loads as a result of the absence of conversion losses. For the main Diesel hybrid propulsion, the system is deemed infeasible. Nevertheless, for the combined Hybrid power train, the savings are achieved by proper handling of the originated energy from the Main and Auxiliary engines.},

However, it does discuss the strengths and weaknesses of manned and unmanned aircraft for certain missions of importance to the Navy. We emphasized traditional Navy mis- sions rather than Navy contributions to irregular warfare, though we included an examination of a few nontraditional missions such as counter-piracy.

abstract = {As additive manufacturing (AM) evolves to become a common method of producing final parts, further study of this computer integrated technology is necessary. The purpose of this research is to evaluate the potential impact of additive manufacturing improvements on the configuration of spare parts supply chains. This goal has been accomplished through scenario modeling of a real-life spare parts supply chain in the aeronautics industry. The spare parts supply chain of the F-18 Super Hornet fighter jet was selected as the case study because the air-cooling ducts of the environmental control system are produced using AM technology. In total, four scenarios are investigated that vary the supply chain configurations and additive manufacturing machine specifications. The reference scenario is based on the spare parts supplier's current practice and the possible future decentralization of production and likely improvements in AM technology. Total operating cost, including downtime cost, is used to compare the scenarios. We found that using current AM technology, centralized production is clearly the preferable supply chain configuration in the case example. However, distributed spare parts production becomes practical as AM machines become less capital intensive, more autonomous and offer shorter production cycles. This investigation provides guidance for the development of additive manufacturing machines and their possible deployment in spare parts supply chains. This study contributes to the emerging literature on AM deployment in supply chains with a real-world case setting and scenario model illustrating the cost trade-offs and critical requirements for technology development. {\textcopyright} 2013 Elsevier B.V.},

We have simulated crane operations in port using both solutions, in order to quantify the potential economic gains of using hybrid power generation. This study is based on a real open-hatch dry bulk vessel of 50,000dwt, which is compared with a corresponding newbuilding ship with hybrid auxiliary power generation. We have modelled the complete auxiliary power system, including diesel generators, lithium-ion batteries, cranes and ship hotel consumers. We have developed a novel hybrid control strategy that has the potential to reduce the minimal size and thereby cost of batteries for hybrid ships. Our results indicate that the hybrid solution will lead to about 30{\%} reduced fuel consumption and CO2 emissions while operating cranes, which amounts to annual savings of {\$}110,000, with {\$}450,000 savings over three years of operation, as well as reduced capital costs compared to the conventional power generation system.},

abstract = {—The evolution of the use of electricity in marine vessels is presented and discussed in this article in a historical perspective. The historical account starts with its first commercial use in the form of light bulbs in the SS Columbia in 1880 for illumination purposes, going through the use in hybrid propulsion systems with steam turbines and diesel engines and transitioning to our days with the first case of electric marine vessel entirely based on the use of batteries in 2015. Electricity use is discussed not only in the light of its many benefits but also of the challenges introduced after the emergence of the marine vessel electrical power system. The impact of new conversion technologies like power electronics, battery energy storage and the dc power system on the trajectory of this development is thoroughly discussed. The article guides the reader through the different stages of this development influenced by the different forms electricity took in the marine vessel, with emphasis on how electricity was used has impacted the marine vessel power system development.},

The control of IGBT0s firing angle is achieved by symmetric pulses generated by a PWM module.

abstract = {While the GHG emissions from international maritime transport decreased by 13{\%} between 2007 and 2012, they are projected to double in the period up to 2050. These are the main results of the Third IMO GHG Study, 2014, which was adopted by the IMO in October 2014. CE Delft was a member of the consortium that carried out the study and was responsible for the emission projections. The decrease in emissions in recent years can be attributed largely to vessels slowing down. Fleet activity during the period 2007-2012 demonstrates widespread adoption of slow steaming. The average reduction in at-sea speed relative to design speed was 12{\%} and the average reduction in daily fuel consumption 27{\%}, with many vessel type and size categories exceeding this average. In some oil tanker size categories, reductions in daily fuel consumption were approximately 50{\%}, while certain container ship size categories reduced energy use by over 70{\%}. Generally, smaller ship size categories operated without significant change over the period, as evidenced by more consistent fuel consumption and voyage speeds. The future increase in emissions is attributable to a projected increase in activity, driven mainly by increased economic activity. Emissions are projected to increase despite regulatory and market-driven improvements in fleet efficiency. The new shipping emission projection scenarios are based on the Representative Concentration Pathways (RCPs) for future demand of coal and oil transport and Shared Socioeconomic Pathways (SSPs) for future economic growth, which have been developed by the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC). SSPs have been combined with RCPs to develop four internally consistent scenarios of maritime transport demand. These are BAU scenarios, in the sense that they assume that current policies on the energy efficiency and emissions of ships remain in force, and that no increased stringencies or additional policies will be introduced. In line with common practice in climate research and assessment, there are multiple BAU scenarios to reflect the inherent uncertainties in projecting economic growth, demographics and the development of technology.

abstract = {Modeling and optimization of a hybrid power system comprising several different power sources provides a tool to size the individual power system components and to optimize the power system control variables. The hybrid power system is required to meet the demanding requirements of long duration mission of unmanned surface vehicles (USVs). These demands for power may be met by a combination of renewable energy resources, conventional fossil-fueled energy sources and energy storage options. The hybrid power system being considered here comprises a solar array, an ocean wave energy converter, a fuel cell system, a diesel generator and a lithium ion battery pack. The approach gives high priority to natural energy sources, i.e. solar and wave energy converter within the discrete time domain followed by minimization of a cost/energy ratio associated with the storage based energy elements, i.e., battery pack, fuel cell system (H2 storage) and diesel generator (fuel storage). The results show that optimization has been achieved with 19.6{\%} contribution by solar power during daylight hours and 5.53{\%} contribution of the wave energy harvester to meet the load demands. The battery bank contributes 39.7{\%} which is 4.4{\%} above the fuel cell contribution. The diesel generator does not contribute during the stealth mode of operation of the USV mission. The average percentage energy contribution from each source confirmed the priorities based on minimization of cost/energy ratio of hybrid power elements. However, in the first case study the optimized result shows a constraint violation when fuel cell performs slightly higher than the battery. Later, in the second case study, it is corrected by increasing the size of the battery bank. ?? 2011 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.},

abstract = {Seafloor investigations with unmanned underwater vehicles (UUVs) have
been carried out in various situations. It is expected in future that
seafloor investigations of sea area where manned support vessels cannot
enter will be accomplished with UUVs. For searches after an accident and
a disaster, detected objects should be immediately identified. In such
situation, it is convenient to have a system, that transfers UUV status
data and/or observation data from an UUV to a distant base in real time.
Therefore, we have developed the Underwater Real-time Communication
System (URCS) where unmanned surface vehicle (USV) relays UUV status and
Sonar images to a distant base in real-time. The USV communicates with
the UUV by two sets of acoustic device and with the distant support
vessel by satellite communication. For the USV to receive image data
from UUV it is necessary to keep USV just above the UUV, because
high-speed acoustic device used for image data transmission has strong
directivity in general. Therefore, we have developed Parallel Cruising
Technology by using Cooperative Control (PaCTeCC) method. A sea trial of
real-time data transmission of sonar images from the cruising UUV to the
distant support vessel via the USV was conducted in July 2014. In this
paper, we report the details of PaCTeCC method and the experiment
results.},

abstract = {This work deals with the propulsion control aspects relating to some of the most critical emergency manoeuvres of a ship: slam start and crash stop. In these particular situations a very important role is played by the automation system that has to manage the whole propulsive chain (i.e. main engine, mechanical transmission and propeller) in a safe and efficient way. With regard to this, a simulation based design methodology is adopted to develop and test new control schemes for ship propulsion. The proposed control layout is applicable to any type of propulsion systems equipped with controllable pitch propellers, since it is mainly based on the automatic adjustment of the propeller pitch. Thus the desired performance requirements are met through adaptive control strategies able to address the complex issues of slam start, crash stop and similar stressful manoeuvres. The adaptivity of the automation process to several critical propulsive conditions reduces significantly the number of the control parameters to be estimated, as recently demonstrated by the automation design of a new twin-screw ship. For this application, the comparison between simulation results and sea trials data is finally shown for validation design purposes.},

In fact, with the possible exception of Romer's endogenous growth model, neoclassical models assume that all countries employ the same technology, what makes impossible the occurrence of diverging growth rates of per capita income.},

abstract = {A generalized modeling framework for hybrid systems, including both discrete event and continuous-time dynamics, is presented in this paper. It is based on a new type of hybrid Petri nets, involving both modular structures, discrete shared variables and flexible transition predicates. The continuous-time dynamics is given by local differential equations, in a style similar to hybrid automata. This can be compared with existing hybrid Petri nets, where also the continuous-time dynamics is represented graphically, but then in reality limiting the continuous-time behavior to simple flow processes. The hybrid Petri net proposed in this paper works well for any type of continuous-time dynamics, including even differential inclusions, and the result is a compact, flexible and readable mix of graphical and equation based representations. The proposed modeling framework is also applied to a physical robot cell, where the energy consumption of the robot motions is minimized based on a hybrid Petri net model, easily transformed to a mixed integer nonlinear programming problem. The resulting optimization procedure is shown to reduce the energy consumption of the real robot cell by approximately 50{\%}. {\textcopyright} 2015 IEEE.},

abstract = {Hybrid Supervisory Systems can be described as control systems with states that are represented by both discrete and continuous variables. Their dynamics are function of time and depend also on the occurrence of discrete events. The development of Hybrid Supervisory Systems can be divided in two phases. In the 1st Phase, a prototype-model for the Supervisory System is described using a specific formalism and is validated based on the system requirements. In the 2nd Phase, this validated model is converted to the programming language of the Supervisory System. This thesis is focused on the 1st Phase of Hybrid Supervisory System development. It approaches three main issues: (1) the choice of the modelling formalism; (2) how to build the Hybrid Supervisory System model using this formalism; and (3) how to validate the Hybrid Supervisory System using this model. For issue (1), a new modelling formalism is introduced based on Differential Predicate Transition nets (DPT nets) and object-oriented (OO) paradigm. This new formalism is called DPT- OO net. Then, for the issue (2), a modelling procedure that assists the building of the DPT-OO net model using Unified Modelling Language (UML) diagrams is proposed. Finally, for the issue (3), the validation problem is approached by defining a set of properties of the DPT-OO net model that assures the Supervisory System requirements. These properties are then formally verified using a proposed analysis procedure.},

abstract = {This paper introduces an intelligent control system for traffic signal applications, called Fuzzy Intelligent Traffic Signal (FITS) control. It provides a convenient and economic approach to improve existing traffic light infrastructure. The control system is programmed on an intermediate hardware device capable of receiving messages from signal controller hardware as well as overriding traffic light indications during real-time operations. Signal control and optimization toolboxes are integrated into the embedded software in the FITS hardware device. A fuzzy logic based control has been implemented in FITS. In order to evaluate the effects of FITS system, this study attempts to develop a computational framework to evaluate FITS system using microscopic traffic simulation. A case study is carried out, comparing different commonly used signal control strategies with the FITS control approach. The simulation results show that the control system has the potential to improve traffic mobility, compared to all of the tested signal control strategies, due to its ability in generating flexible phase structures and making intelligent timing decisions. In addition, the effects of detector malfunction are also investigated in this study. The experiment results show that FITS exhibits superior performance than several other controllers when a few detectors are out-of-order due to its self-diagnostics feature.},

Standardized descriptions of different scenario stages were achieved by the introducing of knowledge element model and hierarchical theory to express the elements of accident scenario. The application study indicated that both the logic form of hybrid Petri net and feature of attribute expression by knowledge element model were revealed. The scenario situation and evolvement process of the emergent events were presented more comprehensively and it will provide more suggestions for the establishment of emergency knowledge base based on the formalized expression of emergency knowledge.

abstract = {The APS (Advanced Planning and Scheduling) systems are widely used by companies; however, the traditional APS systems cannot deal with problems whose the due date is a strong restriction. The problem derives from the way companies use their scheduling heuristics. This paper addresses this problem by using the concept of time windows with the constraint programming mechanism. A procedure is shown to generate the time windows and how they can be used for the APS systems. The APS heuristic approach that uses the concepts of time windows with constraint programming is introduced to solve problems for which the due date is a strong restriction. These heuristics, with tasks allocation either at the beginning or at the end of the task time window, eliminate the need for a priority scheme. To illustrate the advantage of the proposal, some examples are presented. ?? 2014 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.},

abstract = {The development of the marine industry led to an increasing amount of fuel consumption and greenhouse gases (GHG) emissions. However, it is hard to evaluate the payback and profitability of a hybrid renewable ship without preparing a complete investigation. A dearth of studies compares between the hybrid renewable energy systems (HRES) on land and on ships. Therefore, the main objective of this research work is to provide a novel comparison study for the differences between HRES on land and on ships, utilizing the well-known Hybrid Optimization of Multiple Electric Renewable (HOMER) software. To the best knowledge of the authors, this study is the first to do comparison regarding the HRES on land and on ships. This study is based on the project titled "Study on the Application of Photovoltaic Technology in the Oil Tanker Ship" in China. The load profile data used is real and accurate, depending on the ship navigation route from Dalian in China to Aden in Yemen. The hybrid photovoltaic (PV)/diesel/battery system is found to be the optimum system regardless if it is on land or on ships with annual capacity shortage of 0{\%}, which means this system is a 100{\%} reliable system. The optimal system on land consists of 10,000 kW of PV system, 2000 kW of diesel generators, 500 batteries and 2000 kW of power converters. The optimal system on ship consists of only 300 kW of PV system, 2000 kW of diesel generators, 10 batteries and 200 kW of power converters. The optimal system on ships is able to decrease the amount of GHG emissions by 9,735,632.5 kg during the project lifetime (25 years). In addition, it has capability to decrease the fuel-consumption amount by 2,010,475 L during the project lifetime. This represents an incentive factor to increase the installed capacity of the PV system on the ships that consequently decreases the fuel-consumption amount and the total fuel cost.},

abstract = {This paper introduces a framework for analyzing distributed ship systems. The increase in interconnected and interdependent systems aboard modern naval vessels has significantly increased their complexity, making them more vulnerable to cascading failures and emergent behavior that arise only once the system is complete and in operation. There is a need for a systematic approach to describe and analyze distributed systems at the conceptual stage for naval vessels. Understanding the relationships between various aspects of these distributed systems is crucial for uninterrupted naval operations and vessel survivability. The framework introduced in this paper decomposes information about an individual system into three views: the physical, logical, and operational architectural representations. These representations describe the spatial and functional relationships of the system, together with their temporal behavior characteristics. This paper defines how these primary architectural representations are used to describe a system, the interrelations between the architectural blocks, and how those blocks fit together. A list of defined terms is presented, and a preliminary set of requirements for specific design tools to model these architectures is discussed. A practical application is introduced to illustrate how the framework can be used to describe the delivery of power to a high energy weapon.},

abstract = {Presently, design of supervisory control systems is based on ad hoc design methods. This project attempts to approach the design of supervisory controllers using the structure of continuous and sampled systems. The approach builds on process models, incorporates performance specifications and constraints imposed by the plant and otherwise and synthesises the controller by partial inversion of the process model. This paper describes a modelling technology derived for hybrid systems. The hybrid system consists of a continuous plant forced by commands from the supervisory control system and observed through event detectors. The event detectors generate the "measurements" used as inputs to the supervisory control system. The modelling technology quantises the state space systematically and leads to discrete-event dynamic process models that depend on the discrete inputs and the effects of the environments of the plant. Modelling and control of a simple plant is discussed. The resulting controlled systems are analysed for undesirable effects.},

abstract = {This paper compares the criteria weighting process of four sustainable construction assessment tools: LiderA, SB ToolPT, Code for Sustainable Homes, and LEED for Homes 2012. The actual weights are first discussed in conceptual and numerical terms by benchmarking those in the four tools that have similar criteria. These four tools are then used to assess the sustainability level of a Portuguese residential project, the Pal{\'{a}}cio dos Condes de Mur{\c{c}}a (Counts of Mur{\c{c}}a Palace), to discuss the real influence of the weighting process on the final classification, in a real situation. Based on these two approaches, the work debates how the weighting process can contribute to the quest for passive net zero-energy buildings (NZEBs). In other words, this paper intends to ascertain whether the energy criteria's weighting is singling out bioclimatic principles as a priority for NZEBs. In conclusion, this work showed that the four different weighting sets are robust and generally similar. In fact, the case study analysis demonstrated that the final class is equivalent in the various tools. However, as far as energy is concerned, it is not clear whether the tools are pointing to passive design as the primary answer to achieve efficient NZEBs. {\textcopyright} 2013 Elsevier B.V.

Naval reactors have some differences from stationary PWR because they have limitations on volume and weight, requiring compact solutions. On the other hand, a source of problems in naval reactors across history is the steam generation function. In order to reduce nuclear containment footprint, it is desirable to employ integral designs, which, however, poses complications and design constraints for recirculation type steam generators, being interesting to employ once through steam generators, whose historic at Babcock {\&} Wilcox is better than recirculation steam generators. Plate and shell heat exchangers are a mature technology made available by many suppliers which allows heat exchange at high temperature and pressure. This work investigates the feasibility of the use of an array of welded plate heat exchangers of a material approved by ASME for pressure barrier (Ti-3Al-2.5V) in a hypothetical naval reactor. It was found it is feasible from thermal-hydraulic point of view and presents advantages over other steam generator designs.},

abstract = {The current U.S. global defense posture—that is, the location and pri- mary operational orientation of the nation's military personnel and the military facilities that its troops have access to—is under increasing pressure from a number of sources, including budgetary constraints, precision-guided weapons that reduce the survivability of forward bases, and host-nation opposition to a U.S. military presence. These debates over the shape of the U.S. overseas military pres- ence are not without precedent. As policymakers today evaluate the U.S. forward military presence, it is important that they understand how and why the U.S. global posture has changed. This monograph aims to describe the evolution of the U.S. global defense posture from 1783 to the present and to explain how the United States has grown from a relatively weak and insular regional power that was primarily concerned with territorial defense into the preeminent global power, with an expansive system of overseas bases and forward-deployed forces that enable it to conduct expeditionary operations around the globe. Moreover, this historical overview has important implications for current policy and future efforts to develop a U.S. military strat- egy, in particular, the scope, size, and type of military presence over- seas. As new and unpredictable threats emerge, alliance relationships are revised, and resources decline, past efforts at dealing with similar problems may yield important lessons for future decisions.},

abstract = {The recent trend to design more efficient and versatile ships has increased the variety in hybrid propulsion and power supply architectures. In order to improve performance with these architectures, intelligent control strategies are required, while mostly conventional control strategies are applied currently. First, this paper classifies ship propulsion topologies into mechanical, electrical and hybrid propulsion, and power supply topologies into combustion, electrochemical, stored and hybrid power supply. Then, we review developments in propulsion and power supply systems and their control strategies, to subsequently discuss opportunities and challenges for these systems and the associated control. We conclude that hybrid architectures with advanced control strategies can reduce fuel consumption and emissions up to 10–35{\%}, while improving noise, maintainability, manoeuvrability and comfort. Subsequently, the paper summarises the benefits and drawbacks, and trends in application of propulsion and power supply technologies, and it reviews the applicability and benefits of promising advanced control strategies. Finally, the paper analyses which control strategies can improve performance of hybrid systems for future smart and autonomous ships and concludes that a combination of torque, angle of attack, and Model Predictive Control with dynamic settings could improve performance of future smart and more autonomous ships.},

abstract = {Hybrid-Electric Propulsion Systems (HEPS) have emerged as a promising area of research in aerospace engineering as they combine the complementary advantages of internal combustion and electric propulsion technologies while limiting the environmental emissions. Despite the promising benefits, the insufficient energy densities and specific energies of electrical storage devices are major challenges as they induce severe weight and volume penalties. Significant opportunities are nonetheless emerging thanks to optimised propulsive profiles, energy harvesting techniques and more electric aircraft technologies. To support further research on hybrid electric aircraft, the aim of this study is to develop a HEPS retrofit design methodology for existing Remotely Piloted Aircraft Systems (RPAS). The implemented HEPS models use power state variables, allowing more accurate predictions of energy converter efficiency than with power-based approaches. Data from commercially available products is introduced and a case study is presented assuming a reference RPAS platform and performing parametric studies for traditional, electric and hybrid configurations. Range and endurance performances are investigated in depth and the most significant dependencies on design parameters are analysed. The results suggest that HEPS technology represents a viable trade-off solution in small-to-medium size RPAS, promoting the mitigation of noxious and greenhouse emissions while providing adequate range and endurance performance.},

In order to establish the state of the art, this paper reviews emerging concurrent and collaborative engineering approaches and emphasizes on the integration of different application systems across product life cycle management (PLM) stages. It is revealed that checking product information validity is difficult for the current computer-aided systems because engineering intent is at best partially represented in product models. It is also not easy to maintain the consistency among related product models because information associations are not established. The purpose of this review is to identify and analyze research issues with respect to information integration and sharing for future concurrent and collaborative engineering.

abstract = {Simulation technology is a type of shipbuilding product lifecycle management solution used to support production planning or decision-making. Normally, most shipbuilding processes are consisted of job shop production, and the modeling and simulation require professional skills and experience on shipbuilding. For these reasons, many shipbuilding companies have difficulties adapting simulation systems, regardless of the necessity for the technology. In this paper, the data model for shipyard production simulation model generation was defined by analyzing the iterative simulation modeling procedure. The shipyard production simulation data model defined in this study contains the information necessary for the conventional simulation modeling procedure and can serve as a basis for simulation model generation. The efficacy of the developed system was validated by applying it to the simulation model generation of the panel block production line. By implementing the initial simulation model generation process, which was performed in the past with a simulation modeler, the proposed system substantially reduced the modeling time. In addition, by reducing the difficulties posed by different modeler-dependent generation methods, the proposed system makes the standardization of the simulation model quality possible.},

abstract = {Hvor et h{\o}jt niveau af politisk integration i EU's medlemsstater har fundet sted gennem EU's indre politikomr{\aa}der, ser det anderledes ud for storpolitiske omr{\aa}der, som udenrigs-, sikkerheds- og forsvarspolitik, hvor den politiske integration i mindre grad har fundet sted i medlemsstaterne. Medlemsstaternes divergerende tilgange til udenrigspolitiske sp{\o}rgsm{\aa}l hindrer derfor ofte EU i at handle som {\'{e}}n akt{\o}r i internationale kriser. Specialet unders{\o}ger s{\aa}ledes EU's evne til at agere som international akt{\o}r med fokus p{\aa} den traditionelle forst{\aa}else af begrebet udenrigspolitik. Teoretisk tr{\ae}kkes der p{\aa} Christopher Hills artikel fra 1993 om kl{\o}ften mellem de forventninger EU s{\ae}tter til sig selv som international akt{\o}r, og de kompetencer Unionen reelt har og fom{\aa}r at bruge (the capability-expectations gap). Der perspektiveres endvidere, med afstandstagen, til Ian Manners teori om normativ magt og id{\'{e}}en om, at EU kan manifestere sin internationale rolle ved, gennem sin egen konstruktion p{\aa} normer, som fred, retsregler og demokrati, at p{\aa}virke andre akt{\o}rer til at indf{\o}re samme normer. Kritikken af Manners sker prim{\ae}rt gennem Karen E. Smiths argument om, at for at forst{\aa} EU som international akt{\o}r er det ikke tilstr{\ae}kkeligt at se p{\aa} hvordan EU er konstrueret, men n{\o}dvendigt at diskutere, hvordan EU handler p{\aa} den internationale scene. Til denne diskussion tages udgangspunkt i de udenrigspolitiske debatter om henholdsvis Irakkrigen, opr{\o}ret i Libyen og den syriske borgerkrig, og hovedfokus er p{\aa} sp{\o}rgsm{\aa}let om milit{\ae}r intervention i alle tilf{\ae}lde. Det h{\ae}vdes, at trods EU har udviklet b{\aa}de en f{\ae}lles udenrigs- og sikkerhedspolitik samt en f{\ae}lles forsvars- og sikkerhedspolitik og endvidere projicerer en selvopfattelse af at kunne agere internationalt, handler medlemslandene ikke i enhed, men individuelt ud fra egne strategiske interesser og normer, hvilket betyder, at EU kraftigt undermineres som international akt{\o}r. For en dybere forst{\aa}else af EU's evne til at agere som international akt{\o}r samt forholdet mellem forventninger og kompetencer, gennemg{\aa}s den institutionelle udvikling, der har fundet sted siden oprettelsen af FUSP, inden de n{\ae}vnte udenrigspolitiske debatter diskuteres. Det konkluderes sidst, at trods EU har taget skridt mod at kunne agere som en selvst{\ae}ndig, international akt{\o}r, er forventningerne ligeledes blevet h{\ae}vet, og idet medlemsstaterne stadig handler forskelligt fra hinanden, s{\aa} EU's handlekraft undergraves, best{\aa}r en kl{\o}ft mellem EU's reelle kompetencer og de forventninger, der er sat.},

abstract = {Since the late 1980s, there has been a growing interest in the use of foundational ontologies to provide a sound theoretical basis for the discipline of conceptual modeling. This has led to the development of ontology-based con- ceptual modeling techniques whose modeling primitives reflect the conceptual categories defined in a foundational ontology. The ontology-based conceptual modeling language OntoUML, for example, incorporates the distinctions underlying the taxonomy of types in the Unified Foundational Ontology (UFO) (e.g., kinds, phases, roles, mixins etc.). This approach has focused so far on the sup- port to types whose instances are individuals in the subject domain, with no provision for types of types (or categories of categories). In this paper we ad- dress this limitation by extending the Unified Foundational Ontology with the MLT multi-level theory. The UFO-MLT combination serves as a foundation for conceptual models that can benefit from the ontological distinctions of UFO as well as MLT's basic concepts and patterns for multi-level modeling. We dis- cuss the impact of the extended foundation to multi-level conceptual modeling.},

abstract = {When developing control systems for diesel generators, tuning of the controller's parameters to achieve acceptable performance is a significant challenge, particularly while satisfying input, emission, and safety constraints in the face of unknown system disturbances. Robust economic model predictive control (EMPC) can simplify this process by directly addressing the generator's objectives, while systematically handling constraints in a robust way. This paper details how robust EMPC can be implemented as the control solution for diesel generators. To illustrate the process, two distinct generator applications are considered. The first application is a power tracking diesel generator, operating under emissions constraints. Such an application is found in series hybrid electric vehicles. The second application concerns diesel generators onboard submarines. In this application, engine speed and exhaust temperatures must be kept constant, despite significant system disturbances. An experimental study highlights the effectiveness of the EMPC as a solution for both applications.},

Among these ECS components CB2 receptors have been the subject of considerable attention, primarily due to their promising therapeutic potential to treat numerous pathologies while avoiding the adverse psychotropic effects that can accompany CB1 receptor-based therapies. Recently, our research group has reported a new series of non-cytotoxic benzo[d]imidazoles and benzo[b]thiophenes displaying high CB2/CB1 selectivity index. In order to investigate the structural requirements for CB2 ligands and to derive a predictive model that can be used for the design of novel selective CB2 ligands, a three-dimensional quantitative structure-activity relationship (3D-QSAR) study was performed on the above mentioned chemical series employing comparative molecular field analysis (CoMFA) and comparative molecular similarity index analysis (CoMSIA) techniques. The CoMFA and CoMSIA models displayed high external predictability (rpred(2) 0.919 and 0.908) and good statistical robustness. Valuable information regarding the steric, electrostatic and hydrophobic properties of the molecules was obtained, and several modifications around both heterocycles were evaluated with the aim to generate new promising series of benzo[d]imidazoles and benzo[b]thiophenes derivatives displaying high CB2 selectivity and low toxicity.},

One such effort is to extend Petri nets with object-oriented concepts. This paper informally introduces colored object-oriented Petri nets (COOPN) with the application of the AUV system. According to the characteristic of the AUV running environment, this paper uses object-oriented method not only to disport system modules but also to construct refined running model of AUV system. Then it uses the COOPN method to establish hierarchically detailed model in order to get the performance analyzing information of the system},

abstract = {Due to the constant improvement of point-to-point underwater acoustic communication technology, underwater acoustic communication networks in oceans will become a reality. In recent years, unmanned vehicles such as AUVs and Gliders, have gradually matured and been perfected, and can be used as a novel kind of underwater acoustic node. In this paper, a novel Unmanned Surface Vehicle (USV) integrated underwater acoustic modem is introduced. Due to the complexity of underwater acoustic channels, the harsh marine environment and aspects of the USV's manipulation, underwater acoustic communication that links modeling and estimation is essential for USV communications and applications. Firstly, the underwater acoustic communication distance, USV running condition and the Marine environment are considered as the main factors affecting a USV's acoustic communication. Corresponding to the above factors, communication energy loss model, USV motion model and marine environmental impact model are established respectively. Secondly, analyzing the interactions among the three models, a USV underwater acoustic communication link strength model is constructed. Lastly, USV underwater acoustic communication is tested on our USV carrying an EvoLogics acoustic modem, icListen self-contained hydrophone, CTD, electronic compass and GPS at Jihongtan reservoir in Qingdao in July 2015. In the experiments, the bank station transmitting modem is fixed at a depth of 2m, and the receiving modem is integrated in our USV at a depth of 3m. Underwater acoustic communications for fixed points at 50m intervals, and for mobile reception, are executed in a 1000m line respectively. Verification and inspection of the proposed communication link strength model are carried out by analyzing the signal strength along with the communication distance, signal frequency, roll Angle, pitch Angle, velocity of USV, velocity of sound and noise, From the above experiments, it is concluded that the USV as a mobile - elay node is very effective, and its underwater acoustic communication link strength model can justifiably be adopted to describe its communication ability. This will provide a reference for underwater acoustic applications of USV in the future.},

The PEM fuel cells and Li-ion batteries generated an electric power of 50 kW and stored an energy of 47 kWh, respectively. All of the system components, including the PEM fuel-cell modules, hydrogen storage tanks, DC-DC converters, Li-ion battery packs, and battery charger were newly developed and pre-tested for installation onboard, and the boat was built using an aluminum alloy to arrange the developed PEM fuel-cell-battery hybrid system inside of it. The first fuel-cell-powered boat in Korea was successfully demonstrated in the coastal waters of Busan, Korea. The demonstration exhibited the reliable operation of the fuel-cell-battery hybrid system and boat speeds of 6.6-7.8 knots at a power output of ???85 kW.},

abstract = {Electronic frequency converters are increasingly used nowadays in a wide range of applications. However, due to switching techniques employed, the harmonic distortion of the resulting signals became an important parameter to be considered in the design of such converters. For this reason, special attention has been given to the techniques of pulse width modulation (PWM) aimed at reducing the harmonic content. This paper proposes a new methodology for the determination of the PWM pulses, based on the application of nonlinear numerical optimization technique using the Lagrange algorithm for minimizing an objective function. The application of this new technique enables the minimization of the total harmonic distortion (THD) at the same time that restrictions are imposed on the amplitudes of harmonic components of interest. Numerical results demonstrate the potentiality of the proposed methodology. ? 2012 IEEE.},

Like all diesel-electric conventional submarines the submerged endurance and range of these vessels is limited by battery capacity and vulnerability to detection when snorting. However, in recent years several navies have developed and sometimes retrofitted Air independent power plants (AIPs) into conventional submarines in order to enhance their underwater performance. These developments include closed cycle dynamic heat convertors using liquid fuel and metal combustion and non-combustion devices such as fuel cells and semi-cells. In this paper the options that could be used in for the former Type 2400 submarine are identified and discussed and an analysis is presented of the level of extended endurance which could be expected from the use of various AIPs.},

abstract = {This paper pursues a modeling and simulation (M{\&}S) solution for performing a rigorous damage analysis in the conceptual or preliminary design of an intelligent, self-reconfigurable ship fluid system. As enablers to the solution, two essential elements were identified in the formulation. The first one is the graph-based topological modeling method which will be employed for rapid model reconstruction and damage modeling, and the second one is the recurrent neural network-based, component-level surrogate modeling method which will be used to improve the affordability and efficiency of the M{\&}S computations. The integration of these two methods can deliver computationally efficient, flexible, and automation-friendly M{\&}S which will create an environment for a more rigorous damage analysis. Finally, a demonstration of the damage analysis as it is applied to a notional ship fluid system is provided, with a description of the benefits of this approach. ?? 2011 Elsevier B.V.

abstract = {The global automotive industry is faced with major technological change in the field of propulsion systems. Due to low carbon emission regulations and a rising societal demand for sustainability, original equipment manufacturers (OEMs) are forced to innovate either in the conventional technology or in the technological alternatives such as electric drives or fuel cells. However, OEMs are only marginally switching to electromobility so far, but rather incrementally innovating traditional technologies. This behaviour can be described as sailing ship effect which contains the reaction of an old technology to a new technology by fostering innovation in the old technology. Firstly, the present study contributes to the discussion in literature on the sailing ship effect by combining its underlying ideas and consequences with the rationales of path dependence to demonstrate that such a behaviour may be individually economical rational. Based on these considerations, we respond to the call for further empirical investigation of the sailing ship effect. We show patent-based evidence that there has been a temporary sailing ship effect in the automotive industry concerning traditional and emerging propulsion systems and discuss implications for corporate technology strategy and policy.},

The Simulink model is a forward-facing simulation program used to test different control strategies. The flexible energy optimization algorithm for the propulsion system allows relative importance to be assigned between the use of gasoline, electricity, and recharging. A cerebellar model arithmetic computer (CMAC) neural network approximates the energy optimization results and is used to control the parallel hybrid-electric propulsion system. The hybrid-electric UAV with the CMAC controller uses 67.3{\%} less energy than a two-stroke gasoline-powered UAV during a 1-h ISR mission and 37.8{\%} less energy during a longer 3-h ISR mission.},

abstract = {The increased awareness of building energy consumption and sustainability has resulted in the development of various means of predicting performance and rating sustainability. The Building Research Establishment Environmental Assessment Method (BREEAM) and Leadership in Energy and Environmental Design (LEED) are the most commonly used Performance Rating Systems. To predict energy consumption and award relevant energy performance credits, these systems use computer-based Building Performance Simulation tools (BPS). Predictive inconsistencies between BPS tools have been acknowledged in various studies. The probability of achieving different ratings by using different BPS tools or rating systems raises questions concerning the ability to rate 'sustainability' in a consistent manner. To investigate this, a case-study based inter-model comparative analysis was implemented to examine the extent of the variation in the results produced by three of the most widely used BPS tools (Tas, EnergyPlus and IES), and assess their influence and impact on overall BREEAM and LEED scores. Results showed that different simulation tools resulted in different energy consumption figures, but had only a minor effect on BREEAM or LEED energy performance credit scores. Nonetheless, due to the differences between BREEAM and LEED assessment procedures, the case study building was awarded a considerably different rating level in each. ?? 2013 Elsevier B.V.

abstract = {Unmanned aviation may appear to be a recent development, but its history stretches back to the beginnings of aviation. The first unmanned glider flew a century before the Wright Flyer, and unpiloted, powered aircraft made their appearance in the first decades of the 20th century. Over the last 100 years, a series of technological innovations have expanded the capabilities of unmanned aircraft to the point where they now fulfill an increasing range of civilian and military roles. The central message of this chapter is that the further development of unmanned aviation may be held back more by a lack of attention to human factors than by technological hurdles. This chapter begins with a brief overview of unmanned aircraft systems (UAS), from their historical beginnings to the present. Next, the accident record of unmanned aviation is reviewed. The emerging human factors of UAS operation are then examined under the broad headings of teleoperation, design of the ground control station (GCS), transfer of control, airspace issues, and maintenance. If unmanned systems are to reach their full potential, it will be necessary to address each of these issues. ?? 2010 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.},
